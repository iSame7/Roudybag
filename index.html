<a id="problem" class="anchor" href="#problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem:</h3>

<p>As per research a lot of people forgot their keys every day specially adults.
The top items forgotten are mobile chargers, keys, mobile phones, glasses, books, headsets toothpaste and toothbrush.
Think a bout how many times you forgot any of those belonging and went through the hassle of going back to home or sometimes traveling and forgetting these valuable items.
There are a lot of solutions that work with the smart phone and none of them work with the back itself.</p>

<h3>
<a id="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution:</h3>

<p>We've designed Roudy bag it's modern and innovative bag. Consumers/users shall stick a low power Bluetooth tag to any of their items and Roudy bag will detect the items when they are inserted into it and it shall provide sound and Led Alarm on the bag. If the consumer/user leave any place without the pre-set items, he shall receive a notification on his smart phone(iOS,android) and on his smart watch(Apple Watch, Mot360,...) as well.</p>

<p>Roudy Bag shall track consumer/user transaction such taking out an item or bringing another item. The location of transaction shall be kept using the smart phone GPS and location services. The consumer/user can set a must-have list of items and if he leaves his place without any of those items, he shall receive a notification on his mobile and smart Watch.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
