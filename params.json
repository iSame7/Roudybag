{"name":"Roudy","tagline":"","body":"### Problem:\r\nAs per research a lot of people forgot their keys every day specially adults.\r\nThe top items forgotten are mobile chargers, keys, mobile phones, glasses, books, headsets toothpaste and toothbrush.\r\nThink a bout how many times you forgot any of those belonging and went through the hassle of going back to home or sometimes traveling and forgetting these valuable items.\r\nThere are a lot of solutions that work with the smart phone and none of them work with the back itself.\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\nWe've designed Roudy bag it's modern and innovative bag. Consumers/users shall stick a low power Bluetooth tag to any of their items and Roudy bag will detect the items when they are inserted into it and it shall provide sound and Led Alarm on the bag. If the consumer/user leave any place without the pre-set items, he shall receive a notification on his smart phone(iOS,android) and on his smart watch(Apple Watch, Mot360,...) as well.\r\n\r\nRoudy Bag shall track consumer/user transaction such taking out an item or bringing another item. The location of transaction shall be kept using the smart phone GPS and location services. The consumer/user can set a must-have list of items and if he leaves his place without any of those items, he shall receive a notification on his mobile and smart Watch.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4720325/9910854/882a16e0-5c9f-11e5-9aa3-c4dc8ffb9caf.png)\r\n\r\n### Technology:\r\nRoudy Bag core technology is The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer or for now The Arduino YÃºn.\r\nOne of the cool features of Roudy Bag is that it will have a power bank to charge your smart phone on the go. It may be also have a touch screen to interact directly to the board Raspberry Pi/Arduino.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to Support/join this project?
